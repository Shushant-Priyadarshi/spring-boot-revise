► SpringBoot: springboot is a framework which is use to simplify the development
    of java based web applications.

⭐️Why Springboot?
    1) It minimizes the boiler plate code , replace XML configurations with
        annotations and provide pre-configured setups.
    2) It provides a embedded server (tomcat default).
    3) It is ideal for building modern microservices due to its features like
        dependency injection, configuration management, and cloud integration.
    4) Version of dependencies is also taken care of.

⭐️Introduction:

    🎯Creating a springboot application from scratch:
        1) Create a simple maven project.
        2) Add the Spring starter web dependency to the pom.xml
        3) create your hello controllers.
        4) now create your main methods.

            @ComponetScan
            @EnableAutoConfiguration
            public class App{
                   public static void main(String args[]){
                        SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(App.class);
                        app.run();
                   }
            }



    🎯Internal working of Springboot.

        1)SpringApplication:
            SpringApplication.run() method create a web application context and
            create the IOC CONTAINER which manage all the objects required for the projects.
            Those classes which is  annotated with @Component the objects are created.
            Now the App.class or the class is provided in the application run method
            it will scan all the classes from that package.


    🎯Jar vs Fat Jar Files:

        1)Jar Files: collection of .class files (application code)
              code compile => byte code => .class file



        2)Fat Jar : Contains your application's .class files and resources plus all
                external dependencies.

                 👉The target folder inside the springboot project gets the jar files of
                              the project and we can share this jar file to anyone and they can directly
                              run our project through that jar file.


    🎯Application.properties  VS Application.yml:
        Application.properties : Properties file with key=value pairs.
        Application.yml : YAML file with a hierarchical, structured format using indentation.


⭐️REST API:

   👉API(Application Programming Interface) :It's a set of functions and procedures that allow
         applications to access data and features from other applications,services, or operating systems.
   👉REST API(Representational State Transfer API): a type of application programming interface (API) that
         allows computer systems to exchange data over the internet.

⭐️SpringBoot vs SpringBoot MVC:

    👉Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the setup, development, and
    deployment of Spring-based applications. It provides a ready-to-use environment with embedded servers, sensible
    defaults, and auto-configuration features.

    👉Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web framework within the larger Spring Framework. It follows the MVC
    architectural pattern, where:
        👉Model: Handles data and business logic.
        👉View: Represents the UI (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
        👉Controller: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to business logic.
